== Description ==

## A tiny chat widget with a big voice

Tiny Finch is a lightweight live chat widget that connects your website visitors directly to your Slack workspace — no new tools, logins, or learning curves. It’s fast, easy, and efficient.  

When you install Tiny Finch, we automatically create a dedicated Slack channel (#tinyfinch) in your workspace. Messages from your website visitors land there instantly. Just reply in a thread, and your message is delivered straight back to the widget in real time.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I install Tiny Finch? =
For Wordpress, this plugin does the hard work of adding the right script tag on your website.  
You'll just need to configure two parameters:  
* Your Team ID: visible in [the Team section of your Tiny Finch dashboard](https://tinyfinch.chat/dashboard/team/basic-info/)
* A profile name: if you do not have created several profiles, it's just the name "default". Otherwise it is the name you have chosen for your specific customization visible in [the Widget section of your Tiny Finch dashboard](https://tinyfinch.chat/dashboard/widget/).

= Can I customize the appearance of the Tiny Finch widget? =
Yes! You can completely **change the appearance** of the chat bubble and the widget.  

For example, you can modify the colors, font, size, and roundness. There are no limits; you can make the modifications you want easily!  

We've written a [blog article](https://tinyfinch.chat/blog/articles/customization/) to explain it in detail.

= How much does Tiny Finch cost per month? =
Tiny Finch costs $20 monthly, or $200 yearly (which is $16.67 monthly).

= Does Tiny Finch have a free plan? =
No, Tiny Finch does not have a free plan.  
However, you have access to a **one-month free trial** to thoroughly test the solution before committing.  

We decided not to offer free plans like some of our competitors because they are often limited and only exist to convert you to paid plans. We aim to provide a frustration-free experience with an affordable plan without limitations. 

= How many messages can I receive per month? =
You can receive as many messages as necessary.
Tiny Finch has **no limit** on the number of messages per month, so you don't have to worry.

= Can my entire team respond? =
Yes! Just add the members of your team to the Slack channel *#tinyfinch* which was created by our Slack bot. All members of this channel can read and respond in the message thread.  

A Slack channel can hold up to 1000 people, so you have plenty of room! We haven't placed any limitations on the number of people who can respond, unlike some of our competitors. 

= Do I need a credit card to try Tiny Finch? =
No you do not need a credit card to start the **one-month free trial** of Tiny Finch.  

But if you want to keep using Tiny Finch after the trial period, you will need to subscribe with your credit card.  

Subscribe before the end of the trial period to avoid interruption. It will be debited at the end of the trial period anyway.  

= Can I receive visitor messages via email? =
No, visitor messages are only sent to the Slack channel *#tinyfinch*.  
We follow the "keep it simple" principle by centralizing everything on Slack, your everyday tool.  

= Are the messages instant? =
Yes! You can test it yourself; messages take **less than a second** to be transmitted from your website to your Slack space.  

You can provide very efficient customer service with Tiny Finch!  

= Can I install Tiny Finch only on the homepage of my website? =
Yes! Just use our URL whitelisting feature to choose exactly on which pages Tiny Finch will appear.
